## Related Class: Introduction to R {.alert .alert-success}

Daniel Lemmer is offering an [introduction to R](http://univis.fau.de/form?__s=2&dsc=anew/lecture_view&lvs=phil/dsp/isoz/zentr/einfhr_4&anonymous=1&founds=phil/dsp/ipowi/zentr/argent,/spanie,///isoz/zentr/einfhr_4&sem=2018w&__e=808) (in german) as a seminar in this winter term 2018.
In this class (*fossos*), we will be using R, but we will *not* include (nor require) a full introduction to (especially base) R.
Instead, we will focus on broader open source practices and paradigms, using R as an example, but also covering recent developments in [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) R.
You do not *need* to also attend the "Introduction to R seminar"", but participation in both may give you a deeper understanding and command of a more fully-fledged stack.


## German Title {.alert .alert-info}

Depending on who will be attending the class, instruction may also occur in english or german.
In any event, all of the readings and other course material are english, and participants are expected to be proficient in reading and writing english technical documents.

Here, for the sake of completeness, is the german title:

> Open Source Werkzeuge für die wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung


## Course Description

Digitisation has created both new challenges and yet unrealised potentials for empirical social sciences. 
Larger, and often streamed datasets require more programmatic and dynamic statistical analyses. 
Existing commercial programs with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are expensive, and analyses can easily become intransparent, sometimes contributing to a crisis of reproducibility in the social sciences and beyond [cf. @MairThouShaltBe2016] or even propagating outright bugs [cf. @ReinhartGrowthTimeDebt2010].

Happily, the open source community has already pioneered a set of technologies and conventions for their software development efforts, that have proven useful in solving these problems in many academic fields. 
Unfortunately, learning these tools takes more time than is usually available until any given project deadline.

The goal of this seminar is therefore to train participants in a coherent set of leading tools and best practices, including:

- Separating content and presentation using plain-text formats for technical and scientific writing, including LaTeX, Pandoc Markdown and RMarkdown.
- Establishing an efficient plain-text workflow using editors and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), including Atom and RStudio.
- Introducing the world of UNIX-style command-line interface (CLI) programs and package managers, such as homebrew or APT.
- Creating programmatic statistical analyses with R, including a (cursory) introduction to R and the tidyverse.
- Learning source control management (SCM) and massively collaborative development using Git and GitHub.
- Preparing graphical summaries of data, using ggplot2.
- Preparing interactive summaries of data, shiny.
- Rendering results in a variety of formats (Word, HTML, PDF), using RMarkdown and bookdown.
- Strengthening reproducibility by applying assertions (checkmate), dependency management (packrat) and continuous integration and deployment (Travis).

Towards the end of the seminar, participants will be able to use this toolchain to work on their own projects.

```{r venn, fig.cap="The [Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) by Drew Conway (2010)", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/Data_Science_VD.png")
```

This seminar provides a broad introduction and furnishes participants with an end-to-end consistent toolchain, but does not go into great depth of any particular tool. 
The class will also *not* focus on math and statistics knowledge or substantive sociological expertise, though both are essential for solid data science work.
Rather, the emphasis is on what Drew Conway loosely called *hacking skills* in his [Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), that is, simply getting these tools to work together, to learn how to troubleshoot them, and -- aspirationally -- to absorb some best practices of open source development.

While the class is *not* a proper computer science class, it should also be valuable to students with coding experience or a CS background who may be interested in the tooling covered. 

We will not cover the scaling and efficiency issues of proper “Big Data”, but confine ourselves to in-memory problems. 
We also limit ourselves to the R ecosystem, though some tools and problems will be similar for other programming languages such as python.

An introduction to data science and open source may well open up new job opportunities, or serve as a first stepping stone to a career in tech, but that is arguably not the only reason why social scientists should be excited about it. 
Instead, to learn the way of open source is perhaps to update the ideals of the scientific process for the modern day: radical openness and rigorous reproducibility, maximal inclusivity and promised meritocracy, generous sharing and personal attribution. 
Open source may also be a worthwhile exercise in participant observation for social scientists: here is a real, if surely flawed utopia, massively coordinating individuals beyond *both* market and state.

Less loftily, but not least, the seminar also promises a starter dose of gratification from having built something that actually works, and is of some immediate use to our fellow human – a good feeling sometimes hard to come by in the social sciences.


## Crosslistings

This is listed as upper division Bachelor seminar ("Hauptseminar") (7.5 ECTS) in:

- Bachelor Sociology
  - Sociological Methods (Module `SOZ M`, [Soziologische Methodenlehre](https://www.soziologie.phil.fau.de/institut/arbeitsbereiche/methoden-der-empirischen-sozialforschung/))
  - Labor and Organisation (Module `Soz Qf4`, [Arbeit und Organisation](https://www.soziologie.phil.fau.de/institut/arbeitsbereiche/arbeit-und-organisation/))
- Bachelor Digital Humanities and Social Sciences ("BA Zweitfach")
  - tba.


## Prerequisites {.alert .alert-info}

*Everyone* is welcome to this seminar.
This is *not* a "proper" computer science class, and participants do *not* need any background in CS or math.

You should just be curious and ready to:

- learn to use specialised command-line software and open-source tools for collaboration,
- read and write technical documents in simple, readable english and
- collaborate intensively using (perhaps unfamiliar) web-based tools.

No worries, we'll bring everyone up to speed in no time.


## Hardware Requirements {#reqs .alert .alert-warning}

Unfortunately, FAU has no computer lab facilities suitable for teaching this class and participants will have to **bring their own computers**.
This has the advantage that students will learn to set up their own development environments, but adds some unwelcome complexity (different OSes, etc.).

The class will assist students in installing software on their devices, but **students are responsible for maintaining their computers**.
In particular, student laptops must:

- have a reasonably current operating system (MacOS >= 10.13, Microsoft Windows >= Vista, Linux),
- have a current version of a web browser installed,
- *not* be virus-infested or in some other borked-up state,
- *not* be a mobile device (iOS or Android) (unless you can SSH into a Linux box or something),
- and have ready access to one of the WiFi networks at FAU: `FAU-STUD`, `eduroam` or `FAU.fm`. 
  (If you need help setting up your WiFi, consult the RRZE Website.)

Emphatically, none of this requires a new, powerful or expensive device, let alone software.
You can get a used laptop with / ready for Linux Ubuntu on EBay for well under €100 (if you buy a used computer, make sure that the hardware has good Linux support).
With some [tweaking](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/cbds-chromebook), you can even use an inexpensive (x86) Google Chromebook (which kinda runs on Linux).
For more information, see [stack](/stack.html#moving_to_linux).

If you are facing financial difficulties in obtaining a laptop for the class, please contact the instructor.
We'll figure something out for you.


## Expectations

Happily, there are a *lot* of great resources for learning data science tools out there, many of them free, some of them even open source themselves.
We will be reusing a lot of these resources, and I (the instuctor) do not have to reinvent an (inferior) wheel.
There is no *one* curriculum that's quite right for us, so I have cobbled together material from different sources.

All resources are listed along with the [stack](/stack).

The good news is that there are no academic papers or books for this class and everything students need is available online.
There is, however, still a lot of material to work through (to the tune of hours per week), though it is written in a hopefully more accessible style than many academic documents.
The listed resources are guaranteed to cover everything you need to use the software, often including tutorials, videos and exercises.
Students are not limited to the listed resources; they can also choose their own material, so as long as it covers roughly the same ground.
In fact, students are encouraged to share good additional resources with the rest of the class.

<div class="alert alert-warning role="alert">
Students are expected to work through (not just read) all the material listed as resources for the <a href="/stack">stack</a>, *before the session* during which the software is covered (see schedule).
Additional resources are optional.
</div>


## Assessment {.alert .alert-info}

Assessments are an unfortunate, tedious and arguably needless part of teaching -- but here we are, so we are going to make the best of it.

Instead of some *make belief* work or hobby project, for the most part, assignments in this class are designed to be *actually useful* to other people.
This can be motivating, but it also means that other people are relying upon our work: it has to be delivered by the time, and in the quality expected.

We will begin with relatively easy, small tasks to serve other students in class, then address smaller issues with resources for the broader community, and eventually, fixing "real" bugs or enhancing functionality of open source data science software.

All tasks, big and small, are listed and tracked on the [class github repository issue tracker](https://github.com/maxheld83/fossos).
Students should assign themselves to tasks they will be working on, and report / link to any progress on these tasks in the issue thread.

**All students**, including those who **just want a "Sitzschein" (pass/fail option) must contribute to a number of issues labelled as [`pass/fail`](https://github.com/maxheld83/fossos/labels/pass%2Ffail).

Students who want to receive a grade on the class also have to complete at least three issues of two different types labelled as [`graded`](https://github.com/maxheld83/fossos/labels/graded).
Grading criteria are listed for each of the issues.
Generally, a good grade will require following the practices and standards appropriate for the type of contribution in question, and students will need to demonstrate adequate command of the toolchain covered in class.
For an excellent grade, students will need to go (a bit) beyond the covered material, and work on an especially pressing or complicated problem.

There is no straightfoward minimum metric (say, number of closed issues) to pass the class.
Instead, students should display substantial contributions across a range of helpful activities, as recorded in the issue tracker.

As the schedule evolves, the instructor will assign issues to milestones (= class dates).
**Issues have to be completed at 20:00 CET the night *before* the session (= milestone) to which they have been assigned.**

As an alternative to this assessment, if students already have some prior knowledge and a ready project they wish to work on, this can also be arranged.


## Attendance {.alert .alert-warning}

Attendance is not mandatory, as per university policy.
However, students are *highly* recommended to attend the seminar regularly (no more than 2 missed sessions), and to thoroughly study the assigned material.
It is highly unlikely that you will be able to receive passing grades on the assignments otherwise.

Even though technical in nature, this class is no "rocket science", and we will get everyone up to speed, no matter the prior knowledge.
However, you have to work hard and thoroughly, otherwise it is very possible that you will simply fail the class, or receive a very low grade.


## Schedule

The schedule will be evolving throughout the semester, as we see how much progress we make.

The current schedule is listed on the [github issue tracker for this class](https://github.com/maxheld83/fossos/issues).
Milestones will be used as class dates.
The resources are listed in the respective section of the [stack](/stack).
