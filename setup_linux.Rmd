## Linux distributions (distros)
Looking at Linux distributions and deciding for one can be a daunting task if this is new to you.
Keep in mind that while there are notable differences between distros, making an informed choice is very difficult. So just taking a distro and trying it out (it's free!) might be the better choice.
Here are some key differences between distributions:
- _Release Model_
The release model decides how frequently updates reach your system. Frequent smaller updates are called rolling release. If only very big updates are released, it is a point or major release model. 
Also, distros can either focus on well-tested and known software, while others focus on the bleeding edge.
- _Basis and forks_
This is where a lot of names are being dropped, e.g. Arch, Debian, RedHat. While it is not important to remember every name in the beginning, it is important to understand the concept. 
If a distribution derives from another distribution, it is called a fork (similar to the git concept). The basis of a distribution defines e.g. which system tools you have available and thereby also which software packages you can install in general. 
[See this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg) to make out which distro forked from where.
Example:
Manjaro Linux is based on Arch Linux. Therefore, it is a fork of Arch. And while it has its own software repository, due to being derived from Arch it can also install software packages from the Arch User Repository. However, it is not related to Ubuntu, a fork of Debian. So it is basically not possible to install Debian packages in Manjaro. Keep in mind there are almost always ways to work around such limitations.
- _Design principles_
Each distro has its own principles. Some try to be as beginner-friendly as possible (e.g. Ubuntu) and take a lot of choices from the user, while others encourage users to really learn the system (e.g. Arch). Pick a distro and read a little about it to find one that you believe suits your needs.
- _User interface_
This is might be the most surprising aspect about linux and it is a big difference to other operating systems. Looking at a distro, you see its Desktop Environment. In the Linux world, this is just like another package you can install or remove anytime. So if you find a distro that has everything you need, but does not look pleasing to you, there is a good chance you can install a different Desktop Environment and have the same system with different looks.

Summing it up, there are quite substantial differences between the linux distributions. Since it is impossible to understand every linux distro in the necessary detail to make an informed decision, think about what you really need and then just get started

## Tools 
The following tools were tested on Manjaro (fork of Arch Linux), but might also work on other distros.
Keep in mind that software should ideally be installed via the package manager that comes with your distro. For Manjaro, it is Octopi or pacman. Using package managers is more secure and faster than downloading the software from some website. So package managers should always be the starting point for installing software.
- Backup
Backups are essential. No matter if an error was caused by an update or misconfiguration by the user, having a backup can save a lot of hassle. 
  - Software: *Timeshift*, [Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift)
  - Functionality: Timeshift makes it easy to create and restore backups. By default it saves the system configuration, but it can also be configured to backup configuration and all your files. 
  - Comment: Put the Timeshift backups on an external medium, e.g. a USB-drive. In case something goes horribly wrong, the backups won't be affected. 
  Also, having a "rescue system" ready can be helpful to restore these backups. A rescue system can be e.g. a USB-Drive or even a disk with a bootable linux distribution on it. Instructions how to create a bootable medium can be found on the website of most distros.
