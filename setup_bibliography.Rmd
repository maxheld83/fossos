## Bibliography Managers
Bibliography managers are important to keep all the literature you work with well organized.
This page will help you understand pros and cons of different bibliography managers as well as help you set up Zotero, a free and open-source bibliography manager.

## Comparison
There are many different bibliography managers available, e.g. Citavi, Colwiz, EndNote, JabRef, Mendeley, Zotero and ZoteroBib.
While any reference manager producing clean .bib files will be OK, open-source software will enable you to use the programs for years/decades.
In any case, you can get your data out of the tool since it is stored in a transparent way.
Of the named software, only JabRef, Zotero and ZoteroBib are free and open source.
For a detailed feature comparison, you may want to look [here (german)](https://ub.fau.de/schreiben-publizieren/literaturverwaltung/) or [here (english)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).
While the following paragraphs will cover Zotero, please feel free to use any of the other open source bibliography managers.
As long as they can handle the [BibTex format](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) it should be all fine.

## Zotero setup
To get started with Zotero, there are some components that should be set up:

### Zotero itself
*Linux:
   Best way is to use the included package manager.
   Most likely you can find it there.

*Mac:
   Download from the Zotero website or `brew cask install zotero`.

*Windows:
   Best way is to install via chocolatey package manager. Run in command line `choco install zotero`

*Alternative way for all supported platforms:
   Download and install via the [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org/)

### BetterBibTex Addon for Zotero [installation instructions](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)
Prerequisite: Zotero needs to be set up before.
This enables an automatic export of the bib file, among several other features.
During a first manual export via BetterBibTex you can setup automatic exporting and forget about it.
Check [this page](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/push-and-pull/) for more information.

### Zotero-picker Addon for Atom. [installation instructions](https://atom.io/packages/zotero-picker)
Prerequisites: Zotero, BetterBibTex Addon
It enables you to quote and cite directly in Atom.

### (optional, recommended) Zotero connector for your browser [installation instructions](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)
Prerequisite: Zotero
This enables you to add the websites or PDFs you view in your browser directly to your bibliography. And as much as possible will be automatically tagged.

## Using Zotero
This should be pretty straightforward. To learn about the available functions, have a look at the [Zotero Quick Start Guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide)

## Finalizing a document
Navigate with command prompt / bash to the folder your .md document (and in this example, also the .bib file) is stored. The following command will generate a new file in HTML format:
pandoc .\homework.md --bibliography=mybib.bib -o .\Outputs\output.html
- `-o` defines the output location to be a subfolder of the current location.
- The default format is HTML, so this is what will be generated.
