# How to Start

Mastering the entry into open source can be frightening. To make your contribution easier, a collection of links has been compiled here. 

First of all, it makes sense to spend some time on blogs on this topic.

> Are you experiencing a bug with an open source project? Dig in and don’t stop at your local workaround. Your solution can benefit others and lead you to more open source contributions. - [Vincent Voyer](https://github.com/vvo)


## **Blogs and Anchors**

### **A** The Basic One

The introduction in nearly everything is the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). So let's start reading!

**#Appetizer**

> Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!

### **B** First Timers Only: For absolute Newbies

A nice introduction is the initiative of *SHANSELMAN* and *KENTCDODDS*. 

Start [HERE](https://github.com/shanselman/firsttimersonly). 

**#Appetizer** 

> We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to open source can empower the next generation of coders and creators. We VALUE first time contributors and we want them to know that everyone started somewhere! We have gathered a list of resources to motivate and empower you to making that first step into becoming a contributor to the open source realm. If you are an OSS project owner, we have some tips for you to enable you to be instrumental in ushering a new batch of programmers into the community.

### **C** Quick and Easy

A post by [Roshan Josey](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/First-Contributions-project) on [opensource.com](https://opensource.com) briefly describes why it pays to make a contribution in open source and what appeals to it.

**#Appetizer** 

> Contributing to open source projects comes with lots of benefits: You'll have fun, improve your skills, build a profile that could help your career, meet like-minded people, find terrific mentors, and more.

### **D** Ruby Garage: For Starters

If you have already had some programming experience and would describe yourself as a Junior Developer, this [article](https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-contribute-to-open-source-projects) will help you: How Junior Developers Can Contribute to Open Source Projects.

**#Appetizer**

> Previously, we have discussed what are open source projects and why open source is good for your business. In this article, we'll explain why you should contribute to such projects, how to contribute, and what projects to choose. Who are just starting their career and would like to get involved with the community (and maybe become a coding genius).

### **E ** Start your Open Source Carreer - 13 min read to go ahead

Ok. Now it’s time to start your Open Source Career. This [blog](https://blog.algolia.com/start-your-open-source-career/) of Vincent Voyer helps you getting your feet wet. It takes only 13 minutes to read.

**#Appetizer** 

>"I don’t have an idea” is a common complaint by developers who want to contribute to open source but think they don’t have any good ideas or good projects to share. Well, to that I say: that’s OK. There are opportunistic ways to contribute to open source. Many projects have started to list good contributions for first-timers via labels or tags.


## Projects to Contribute

So - ready, steady, go. You can use this [guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) for starting a new project or this [repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for your first contributions.
